**Blackjack Game Javascript**

**DESCRIPTION** </br>
</br>
This Javascript application depicts the blackjack game where a player draws random cards and wins the game if they select cards that add up to 21, stay in the game if sum of cards is less than 21, or is kicked out of the game if sum of cards is more than 21 </br>

**Lessons Learnt** </br>

I built this app following a tutorial by Per Harald Borgen on Free Code Camp. I am in the process of learning JS and so far, this is what I have learnt by building this application: </br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;•	Arrays </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;•	Objects </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;•	Methods </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;•	If, else statements </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;•	For loops </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;•	Math object – Math.floor() and Math.random() </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;•	Return statements </br>
I hope to revisit this project and make it more like the Blackjack game (display cards on screen) </br>
